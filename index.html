  <h1>Meet Vybhoohith 💫</h1>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>📚 9th Grade Dreamer</h2>
    <p>13 years old. Section 9B. A coder, a gamer, and a boy who sees the world a little differently. He’s not just surviving school—he’s building ideas, solving problems, and imagining futures.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I don’t just learn—I imagine. I don’t just study—I feel."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>💘 The Girl From 9A</h2>
    <p>Her name is Kruthika. She’s in another section, but somehow she’s always close. He sees her in the hallway, hears her laugh, and quietly hopes she’ll notice the boy who codes with her in mind.</p>
    <p class="quote">"She doesn’t know it, but she’s the reason I smile more than I should."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🧑‍💻 Coder of Emotion</h2>
    <p>He builds websites, games, and creative projects—each one carrying a spark of his personality. His code isn’t just technical. It’s expressive. It’s how he turns thoughts into something real.</p>
    <p class="quote">"Every tag, every line, every color—written with feeling."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🎮 Gamer by Night</h2>
    <p>When the homework ends, the games begin. Minecraft, BGMI, and custom hacks that reflect his moods. He plays to escape, to create, and sometimes... to imagine a world where she plays too.</p>
    <p class="quote">"One more match... and maybe I’ll build her name in blocks."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🧠 Quiet Legend</h2>
    <p>He’s not loud. He’s not flashy. But he’s brave in his own way. Brave enough to feel deeply. Brave enough to turn admiration into creativity. Brave enough to hope that one day, she’ll see what he’s built and understand what it means.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I may be quiet, but my heart is louder than you think."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    This isn’t just a bio. It’s a beginning. The story of a boy named Vybhoohith—who codes, who dreams, and who quietly admires a girl from 9A.
