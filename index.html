  <h1>Meet Vybhoohith 💫</h1>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>📚 9th Grade Wonder</h2>
    <p>13 years old. Section 9B. A student, a dreamer, and a quiet observer of the world. He doesn’t just go to school—he lives through it, finding meaning in moments others overlook. He’s the kind of boy who thinks deeply, feels quietly, and creates boldly.</p>
    <p>He’s not the loudest in the room, but his thoughts echo louder than most. He learns not just from textbooks, but from emotions, from silence, from the way people move and speak. He’s growing—not just in age, but in heart.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I don’t just study—I search for meaning in everything."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>💘 The Girl From 9A</h2>
    <p>Her name is Kruthika. She’s in another section, but somehow she’s always close. He sees her in the hallway, hears her laugh, and wonders if she knows how much light she brings into his world. She’s not just a crush—she’s a quiet inspiration.</p>
    <p>He doesn’t talk to her much. Maybe never. But he notices everything. The way she smiles. The way she helps others. The way she makes the day feel softer. And even though they’re separated by a single letter—9A and 9B—his heart doesn’t care about labels.</p>
    <p class="quote">"She’s the reason I believe in beautiful things I can’t explain."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🧑‍💻 Coder of Emotion</h2>
    <p>He doesn’t just write code—he writes feelings. Every tag, every function, every color choice reflects something inside him. His projects aren’t just technical—they’re personal. They carry pieces of his story, his hopes, his quiet love.</p>
    <p>He builds things that speak when he can’t. Websites that hold emotion. Games that reflect his mood. Pages that feel like poetry. He’s not just a coder—he’s a storyteller, using HTML and JavaScript to say what words sometimes can’t.</p>
    <p class="quote">"My code is my voice. And sometimes, it whispers her name."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🎮 Gamer With a Heart</h2>
    <p>When the books close, the controller comes out. Minecraft, BGMI, and custom hacks that reflect his imagination. He plays not just to win, but to escape, to build, to feel. His worlds are pixelated, but his emotions are real.</p>
    <p>He’s the kind of gamer who pauses mid-match to think about her. Who builds secret places in Minecraft that no one else sees. Who wonders if she’d ever play beside him, even just once. His games aren’t just fun—they’re full of feeling.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I build worlds where I’m brave enough to say what I feel."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="bio-card">
    <h2>🧠 Quiet Legend</h2>
    <p>He’s not the center of attention. He doesn’t need to be. His strength is in his sincerity. In the way he cares. In the way he creates. In the way he loves without needing to be seen. He’s brave—not in loud ways, but in the way he keeps going, keeps hoping, keeps building.</p>
    <p>He’s the kind of boy who will change the world—not with noise, but with kindness. Not with fame, but with feeling. Not with power, but with love. And maybe one day, she’ll see what he’s built and understand what it means.</p>
    <p class="quote">"I may be quiet, but my heart is louder than you think."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="footer">
    This isn’t just a bio. It’s a beginning. The story of a boy named Vybhoohith—who codes, who dreams, and who quietly admires a girl from 9A. His journey is just starting, and every line of code is a step toward something beautiful.
